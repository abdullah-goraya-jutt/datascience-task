Data Science & AI/ML Internship ‚Äì Advanced Tasks üöÄ

This repository contains my solutions to the Advanced Data Science & AI/ML Engineering Internship tasks at DevelopersHub Corporation.
The tasks provided practical exposure to solving real-world machine learning, data science, and business intelligence problems using industry-standard tools and libraries.

üìå Overview

The internship consisted of 5 advanced tasks, out of which I successfully implemented:

Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer term deposit subscription.

Applied proper encoding of categorical features.

Evaluated performance using Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, ROC Curve.

Used SHAP for explainability on sample predictions.

Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

Performed EDA on the Mall Customers dataset.

Applied K-Means Clustering to group customers by spending habits.

Used PCA/t-SNE for visualization of clusters.

Proposed tailored marketing strategies for each segment.

Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

Preprocessed and resampled Household Power Consumption dataset.

Engineered time-based features (hour, weekday/weekend).

Compared forecasting models: ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost.

Visualized actual vs forecasted energy usage.

Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization

Preprocessed the Home Credit Default Risk dataset.

Trained Logistic Regression and CatBoost models.

Applied cost-sensitive threshold optimization using defined FP/FN costs.

Analyzed feature importance for business insights.

Interactive Business Dashboard (Streamlit)

Built a Streamlit dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset.

Added filters for Region, Category, Sub-Category.

Displayed KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Top 5 Customers by Sales.

Integrated interactive charts for segment-wise performance analysis.
